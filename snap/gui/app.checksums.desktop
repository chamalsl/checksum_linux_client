Name=checksums-app
Comment=A fantastic new application packaged as a snap.
# The Type must be Application for a launchable program
Type=Application
#
# The Exec line is CRITICAL. It specifies the command to run.
# Format: Exec=<snap-name>.<app-name> [arguments]
# Since the snap name (my-super-app) is different from the app name (my-app),
# the full command wrapper is required.
# If snap-name and app-name were the same (e.g., both 'my-app'), you could use Exec=my-app
Exec=checksums-app
#
# The Icon path should point to the icon file within the snap's structure.
# Snapcraft automatically re-locates icons placed in snap/gui/ to a place the desktop can find.
Icon=${SNAP}/meta/gui/app.checksums.svg
